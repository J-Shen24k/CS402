  <h2>Systems Programming Lab #3 - C Pointers</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>1. Goal</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Gain experience using pointers and dynamic memory allocation (malloc) in C.
  </li>
  <li>
    Practice using gdb and valgrind to debug C memory bugs.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Lab Description</h2>

<p>
  For this lab, you will implement a program that reads data from a file and
  computes some basic statistical analysis measures for the data.
</p>
<p>
  The program should work without any changes for data sets of any size, i.e.
  it would work for 10 data values or for 10 million without re-compilation.
</p>
<p>
  Name your program <tt>basicstats</tt>
</p>

<h3>2.1 Program Start-up</h3>
<p>
  Your program will take one command line argument, which is the name of the
  input file containing the data to be analyzed.
</p>
<p>
  Two sample files are provided, <a href="http://cs.iit.edu/~virgil/cs402/mail.spring2020/Labs/C/lab-3/small.txt">small.txt</a> and
  <a href="http://cs.iit.edu/~virgil/cs402/mail.spring2020/Labs/C/lab-3/large.txt">large.txt</a>.

<h3>2.2 Statistic Functions</h3>
<p>
  <b>mean:</b> the average of values in the set. For example, if the set is
  S={5, 6, 4, 2, 7}, then the average is 4.8
</p>
<p>
  <b>median:</b> the middle value in the set of values. For the same set S the
  median value is 5 (2 and 4 are smaller and 6 and 7 are larger).  If the set
  has an even number of values, then you average the two values that are left
  and right of center.
</p>
<p>
  <b>standard deviation:</b> you are going to calculate the
  <i>population standard deviation</i> by using the following formula:
</p>
<pre>  stddev = sqrt((sum((xi - mean)^2))/N);
</pre>
<p>
  where the sum() goess from 1 to N, xi is the i-th element, N is the number of
  elements in the data set, and sqrt() is the square root function.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: To use sqrt() you'll need to link your code with the math library.
</p>

<h3>2.3 File Format</h3>

<p>
  The input file format consists of several lines of ASCII text.  Each row in
  the file is one datum, as a regular decimal number, e.g. 123.45, -6.78901, etc.
</p>

<h2>3. Requirements</h2>
<p>
  Compute the mean (average), the median (the middle value), the standard
  deviation of the set of values and print them out. Hint: You will likely
  need to sort the values prior to computing the median.
</p>
<p>
  Print out the results, plus information about the number of values in the data set
  and the amount of unused capacity in the array storing the values.
</p>
<p>
  The array of values must be dynamically allocated on the heap by calling
  malloc(). You should start out allocating an array of 20 float values. As you
  read in values into the current array, if you run out of capacity:
  </p><ul>
    <li>
      Call malloc to allocate space for a new array that is twice the size
      of the current full one.
    </li>
    <li>
      Copy values from the old full array to the new array (and make the new
      array the current one).
    </li>
    <li>
      Free the space allocated by the old array by calling free.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    NOTE: there are other ways to do the memory allocation/re-allocation than
    described above, however for this assignment you have to use the method
    described above.
  </p>
  When all of the data values have been read in from the file, the function
  should return the filled, dynamically allocated, array to the caller
  (the function's return type is float *). The size and capacity of the array
  should be "passed" back to the caller via the pointer parameters.
<p>
  For full credit, your submission should meet the following requirements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Your code should be commented, modular, robust, and use meaningful variable
    and function names. This includes having a top-level comment describing your
    program and listing your name and the date. In addition, every function
    should include a brief description of its behavior.
  </li>
  <li>
    You should not use any global variables for this assignment.
  </li>
  <li>
    It should be evident that you applied top-down design when constructing
    your submission (e.g., there are
    multiple functions, each with a specific, documented role).
  </li>
  <li>
    You should not assume that we will test your code with the sample input files
    that have been provided.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Try getting your code to work without the re-allocation and copying part
    first (for fewer than 20 values). Once that works, then go back and get it
    to work for larger numbers of input values that require
    allocating new heap space, copying the old values to the new larger space,
    and freeing up the old space.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use doubles to store and compute the mean and the square root.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Submit your work</h2>
<p>
	Here is what you need to deliver on the Blackboard:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A link to your git repository such that we can clone it, build an
    executable and test it.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  NOTE: please make sure your repository contains a README file that explains
  how to build an executable and execute it.
