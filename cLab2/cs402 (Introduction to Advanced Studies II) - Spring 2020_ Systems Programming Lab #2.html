  <h2>Systems Programming Lab #2 - C Programming Basics</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<h2>1. Goal</h2>
  <p>
    The primary goal of this lab is to expand expand and strengthen the skills
    acquired in Lab #1.
  </p>

<h2>2. Lab Description</h2>

<p>
  For this lab, you will exapand the functionality of the employee database
  program you developed in Lab #1.
</p>


<h2>Extra Challenge</h2>

<p>
  Add the following menu option(s) <b>after</b> the QUIT option. Do not
  change the numeric values for the five required options implemented in
  Lab #1:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Remove an employee</li>
  <li> Update an employee's information</li>
  <li> Print the M employees with the highest salaries</li>
  <li> Find all employees with matching last name</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Additionally, you might modify your program to accept an input file that is NOT
  guaranteed to be in sorted order by employee ID, i.e., your program will have
  to do the sorting at start up.
</p>

<p>
  The remove option should prompt the user to enter an employee ID number,
  search for that employee in the DB and if found ask the user if s/he really
  wants to remove.  If so, the employee record should be removed from the array.
  Make sure to leave no holes in the array (i.e. if there are 10 employees, their
  info should be in array buckets 0-9).
</p>

<p>
  The update option can be used to change any field of an employee.  Your
  program should prompt the user to enter an employee ID to first find the
  matching employee whose data you want to change.  The user should have
  the option of changing any or all fields.
</p>

<p>
  For the print highest salaries option your program should prompt the user
  to enter a value for M (e.g. 5), and then print out the employee
  information for the M (5) employees with the highest salary.  Your solution
  should require only one pass through the employee DB. And, remember it is
  important that the Employee database remain sorted by employee ID after this
  menu option is chosen.
</p>

<p>
  For the find all with last name, your program should prompt the user
  to enter a value for the last name (e.g. Smith) and then return information
  about every employee with a matching last name.  The matching should be
  case insensitive.
</p>

<h2>5. Submit your work</h2>
<p>
	Here is what you need to deliver on the Blackboard:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A link to your git repository such that we can clone it, build an
    executable and test it.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  NOTE: please make sure your repository contains a README file that explains
  how to build an executable and execute it.
